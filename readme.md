# RJournals

Demo Xamarin App with a .net 6 Web Api

## HOW TO DEBUG

To debug the Frontend App and the WebAPI. use the UWP versión of the frontend, since the Android versión is not fully compatible with Emulators

### HOW TO RUN ON ANDROID

To test the application on Adnroid, use a physical device, since the Emulators are not fully compatible with the solution. This versión uses a versión of the WebApi temporraly runing on my servers

### FOR DEMO PORPOUSES

- The current research (the user leged in the app) is fixed
- No security is implemented in the WebApi
- Fixed PDF file for reading screen
- In Memory Database is uses so no persitance on the chages to the app
